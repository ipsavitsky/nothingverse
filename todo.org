* Todo:
** Database of posts; rendering of posts, live update of posts (sse again?)
** Make replies to posts
** Make post insubmittable before generation is done
** CSS (tailwind (?))
** Bundling (Do I even need it? How do I pair it with nix?)
** Known issues
*** DONE After sse stream is closed, the connection gets dropped from the pool, which is not good
*** All 3 buttons submit the same first post
