* Todo:
** DONE Database of posts; rendering of posts, live update of posts (sse again? - no, just polling is enough)
** Make replies to posts
** Make infinitely scrollable feed
** CSS (tailwind? just inline my styles?)
** Make post insubmittable before generation is done
** Bundling (Do I even need it? How do I pair it with nix?)
** Known issues
*** DONE After sse stream is closed, the connection gets dropped from the pool, which is not good
*** DONE All 3 buttons submit the same first post
